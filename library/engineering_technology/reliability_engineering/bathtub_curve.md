The 'bathtub' refers to the shape of a line that curves up at both ends, similar in shape to a bathtub.

The bathtub curve has 3 regions:
1. The first region has a decreasing failure rate due to early failures.
2. The middle region is a constant failure rate due to random failures.
3. The last region is an increasing failure rate due to wear-out failures.

A product is said to follow the bathtub curve if in the early life of a product, the failure rate decreases as defective products are identified and discarded, and early sources of potential failure such as manufacturing defects or damage during transit are detected. In the mid-life of a product the failure rate is constant. In the later life of the product, the failure rate increases due to wearout. Many electronic consumer product life cycles follow the bathtub curve.
